# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
* I productively struggled with expressing the proper format...until I was able to understand how to combine information. I also received useful feedback from my pairing partner (thanks OGF Jedeo!)

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
* It is value-added. I will re-type all of my notes and make sure to save it in my notebook.  Yes..it is most helpful.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
* I refer to the class lesson examples on each topic (Object Literals, fFunctions, etc.)
